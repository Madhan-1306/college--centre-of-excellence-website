            <h3>Research 1</h3>
            <p>Title: "Efficient Detection of Parkinson's Disease Using an intelligent wearables with Fog computing Integration"</p>
            <p> Tentative duration: 3 years</p>
            <p>Description: Parkinson's disease (PD), a progressive neurological disorder, requires timely and accurate diagnosis for effective management. Traditional diagnostic methods are often time-consuming, costly, and reliant on centralized systems, limiting access to early detection, especially in remote areas. This proposes an intelligent wearables data integrated with fog computing to address these challenges by enabling efficient, real-time detection of Parkinson's disease.</p>

            <h3>Research 2</h3>
            <p>Title:"Resolution Augmentation of Brain MRI Images Using Deep Learning to Improve Treatment"</p>
            <p>Tentative duration: 3 years</p>
            <p>Description: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the most often utilized medical imaging procedures. It is a technique that doctors use to better understand human anatomy and conduct more precise assessments. In the study of brain anatomy, image processing super-resolution technology has become vital to overcome physical limitations imposed by picture degradation caused by hardware limits, longer scanning times, and artifacts. Here, Enlighten Generative Multiple Identities Representation Network (EGMIRNet) is developed for MRI brain image enhancement. The results of the methods will be compared with the existing approaches to reveal performance improvement.</p>

            <h3>Research 3</h3>
            <p>Title: Pyramid DKN Forward Harmonic Network For Breast Cancer Detection using Histopathological images</p>
            <p>Tentative duration: 3 years</p>
            <p>Description: Breast Cancer ranks as one of the most common malignancies in women globally, and early identification of the illness can save lives. Most disease-related data is sparse. Deep Learning models, on the other hand, require a large amount of data in order to train well. To address this constraint and enhance breast cancer classification, this research offers a novel deep model to classify breast cancer based on two cutting-edge deep neural networks, GoogLeNet and residual block. Using accepted granular computing, shortcut interaction, and two learnable activation functions instead of standard activation functions, and a mechanism for attention, it is projected to increase diagnostic accuracy and reduce doctor workload.</p>

            <h3>Research 4</h3>
            <p>Title: Blockchain for Secure Supply Chain in CPS</p>
            <p>Tentative duration: 3 years </p>
            <p>Description: Blockchain for secure supply chains in cyber-physical systems (CPS) leverages decentralized ledgers to enhance transparency, traceability, and security across global manufacturing, logistics, and shipping processes. By providing an immutable record of product movements, Blockchain ensures that every transaction is tamper-proof and verifiable, thereby preventing counterfeiting and improving product authentication. It also facilitates secure data sharing among stakeholders and automates transactions using smart contracts. However, challenges remain, particularly in developing scalable blockchain solutions that can handle the complexities of global supply chains while keeping operational costs low. Research in this area focuses on optimizing blockchain for CPS integration, balancing security with efficiency.</p>
